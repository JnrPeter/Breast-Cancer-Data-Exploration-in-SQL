# Breast-Cancer-Data-Exploration-in-SQL

## Description of Project Files

- Breast_Cancer_Project.sql : A SQL file containing all the SQL queries for the Project
- README.md : A file containing an overview, summary and description of the entire Project.
- breast_cancer.csv : The dataset used for the project

## Overview of Project
In this Project I performed an exploratory analysis of 4,024 breast cancer patients with infiltrating duct and lobular carcinoma breast cancer diagnosed from 2006 – 2010.The dataset was obtained from the November,2017 update of the SEER Program of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) which provides information on population-based cancer statistics.


## SQL Queries were used to gain insights from the dataset using the questions below
- What is the distribution of the races affected by cancer?
- What is the distribution of the marital status of breast cancer patients?
- What is the patient age distribution ?
- What is the number of patients who have more than two years to survive?
- Which race has more patients with over 2 years of survival ?
- What is the average tumor size amongst the cancer patients?
- What is the number of patients with above average tumor size?
- What is the Percentage of patients with below or above average tumor sizes?
- Find the estrogen status distribution for the various extent of tumors(T_Stage)
- Which age group has the highest number of patients with positive estrogen status?
- How many patients with above average sized tumors tested positive for both hormone receptors(Estrogen and Progesterone)? 
- What is the number of patients who tested positive for both hormone receptors(Estrogen and Progesterone) for each Grade of tumor? 
- How many patients are alive or dead?
- How many patients are alive or dead for each grade of tumor?

## INSIGHTS

From the 4,024 breast cancer patients, it was discovered that 3,413 were white whilst 291 were black, with 320 patients belonging to other races. The number of patients who were alive at the time of data collection was 3,408 whilst those who are dead were 616. The majority (2,643) of patients were recorded to have been married. The most common age range amongst patients was 50-60 years, with about 1,530 patients falling within this age bracket. The total number of patients who had more than two years to live was 3,839 with the majority of these patients being white. The average tumor size was about 30mm with about 66% of patients having tumor sizes greater than this. The 50–60year age group has the highest number of patients with positive estrogen status. The number of patients with below-average-sized tumors who tested positive for both hormone receptors (Estrogen and Progesterone) is higher than patients with above averaged sized tumors. 2,014 patients with grade 2 tumors tested positive for both hormone receptors (Estrogen and Progesterone).
