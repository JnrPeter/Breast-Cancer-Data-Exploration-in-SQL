# Breast-Cancer-Data-Exploration-in-SQL

## Description of Project Files

- Breast_Cancer_Project : An SQL file containing all the SQL queries for the Project
- README.md : A file containing an overview, summary and description of the entire Project.
- breast_cancer.csv : The dataset used for the project

## Overview of Project
In this Project I performed an exploratory analysis of 4,024 breast cancer patients with infiltrating duct and lobular carcinoma breast cancer diagnosed from 2006 â€“ 2010.The dataset was obtained from the November,2017 update of the SEER Program of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) which provides information on population-based cancer statistics.


## SQL Queries were used to gain insights from the dataset using the questions below
- What is the distribution of the races affected by cancer?
- What is the distribution of the marital status of breast cancer patients?
- What is the patient age distribution ?
- What is the number of patients who have more than two years to survive?
- Which race has more patients with over 2 years of survival ?
- What is the average tumor size amongst the cancer patients?
- What is the number of patients with above average tumor size?
- What is the Percentage of patients with below or above average tumor sizes?
- Find the estrogen status distribution for the various extent of tumors(T_Stage)
- Which age group has the highest number of patients with positive estrogen status?
- How many patients with above average sized tumors tested positive for both hormone receptors(Estrogen and Progesterone)? 
- What is the number of patients who tested positive for both hormone receptors(Estrogen and Progesterone) for each Grade of tumor? 
- How many patients are alive or dead?
- How many patients are alive or dead for each grade of tumor?
